You can create AI\nart in seconds just by entering a text prompt. You can also upload your own\nimages, and try your prompts with various AI models and styles to achieve\ndifferent looks.**\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **What is an AI model?**\n\n**An AI model is a program or algorithm that uses training data to perform a\ntask. AI art models are trained with images which, in turn, allows them to\nreplicate the look of those images. For example, a photorealistic AI art model\nwould be trained with more photographs, whereas an anime model would be\ntrained with more anime art.**\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **What is a Style?**\n\n**Styles combine AI models, prompts, negative prompts, and other settings to\ncreate great results in a particular style. Some styles reflect artistic\nmediums, like ink and watercolor. Some create the look of an artistic\nmovement, like impressionism, or a genre, like steampunk.  **\n\n**Some styles represent AI models. Many AI models are trained to achieve a\nspecific result, like photorealism. The corresponding style includes prompts\nchosen to achieve the best results for that AI model.**\n\n\n\n## \u00b6 _**Generating Artwork**_\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **How do I use MonAI?**\n\n  1. **Write a Description. Steampunk airship. Enchanted elven forest. What do you want to create?**\n  2. **Select a style, like Anime or Photorealistic. The styles will select an AI model and possibly add keywords and negative keywords.**\n  3. **Tap the create button. Your art will be ready in seconds.**\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **What is a prompt? How do I create art with prompts?**\n\n**Any text you enter into the description box is a prompt. If you are looking\nfor ideas, tap one of the suggestions below the text box. If you add a style,\nany keywords and negative keywords added by the style will also be part of the\nprompt. Once you press the \u201cCreate\u201d button, the AI will generate artwork based\non its understanding of the prompt.**\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **Why is there a 500 character limit?**\n\n**Stable Diffusion has a limit to how much of a prompt can be processed at one\ntime. Specifically, there is a 150 \u2018token\u2019 limit. Tokenizers help AI to\nunderstand human language, because machines work with numbers, not words. Just\nas words cannot directly translate to numbers, tokens are not directly\ntranslatable to characters, so the 500 character limit is only an estimate.\nMonAI does not force you to use less than 500 characters; however, if you go\nover the token limit, any additional prompts are chopped off and ignored by\nthe AI.**\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **How do I edit a creation?**\n\n**Tap the edit (rectangles) button below the generated image. From there, you\ncan change your text, select a different style, see it with a different AI\nmodel, or change any other settings to modify the results.**\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **What does the \"Remix\" button do?**\n\n**The Remix button generates another artwork with the same prompts as\npreviously used, changing only the initial seed image.**\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **I got an NSFW warning as a prompt result! What should I do?  **\n\n**Don\u2019t panic! You have the option to delete the result immediately, or you\ncan view it anyway. If you had no questionable terms in your prompt, then it\nwas likely a false positive flag for NSFW and viewing the image would more\nthan likely be fine.**\n\n**Some of the photorealistic AI models have a tendency to render nudes if you\ndo not specify a type of clothing. A prompt of \u201cbeautiful woman\u201d may result in\nan artwork of a nude woman. To avoid this, add \u201cnude\u201d and \u201cnaked\u201d to the\nnegative prompts, or specify what you want the woman in the artwork to wear.\n**\n\n\n\n## \u00b6 _**Advanced", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3646, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3756a98-edbf-4ee7-8f17-d65af0c3814c": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3756a98-edbf-4ee7-8f17-d65af0c3814c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3244a9c-f63f-49f8-b244-189248a98aee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a81cbf07832a16cd83b285775df0a82c1dc7dee4b6bc2ddee9781957978fb06f"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e73a343-2c86-406c-bea5-f135f164177d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9484f2afbdd48760a6ee27ae0b4c39a00875be003064831e1dc6bacf6b7c89ba"}, "3": {"node_id": "3a8c9d5f-1880-49d3-8574-464b94f39031", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b8db435351e8f62bd9cc47a29009afd721424b9cf4040ca947a35777c7697e4c"}}, "hash": "11291fe9d49706f28a7cd2427aa8e0c45ddf971795f2e4283985b6c4a48b23bd", "text": "want the woman in the artwork to wear.\n**\n\n\n\n## \u00b6 _**Advanced Options**_\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **What does the \"Guidance Scale\" slider do?**\n\n**Guidance Scale (CFG) controls how much the AI adheres to the prompt.\nIncrease to conform to the prompts, but BE AWARE this often comes at the\nexpense of image quality. Numbers between 4 and 11 yield better results. The\nbest results are seen with numbers from 6-8.**\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **What does the \u201cSteps\u201d slider do?  **\n\n**Images are rendered step by step, starting with a seed image of static. 30\nsteps is generally ideal to generate a high quality image. Increase the steps\nfor more details and cleaner faces at the expense of speed. In most cases,\nincreasing the steps above 45 will not create a significant difference in\nquality.**\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **What is a seed?  **\n\n**The seed number corresponds with a noise pattern, similar to television\nstatic, that is used as the basis for the generated art. Step by step, the AI\nredesigns the static into art according to your prompts. When you change the\nseed number, the AI will reimagine the artwork in a different way. Tapping the\ndie to the right of the seed box randomly generates a seed for you.**\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **How can I change the size of my artwork?**\n\n**In the Advanced Options, there is a section for Size with several options\navailable (512x1024, 512x768, 512x512, 1024x512, 768x512, 768x768, and\n768x960).**\n\n\n\n## \u00b6 _**Negative Prompts & Negative Embeddings**_\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **What is a \"Negative Prompt\"?**\n\n**Use negative prompts for things you want to exclude or fix. If you render a\nhouse in the desert, and the result has plants you don't like, use \"plants\" as\na negative prompt to remove them.  **\n\n**You can also use Negative Prompts to fix common AI art problems like missing\nlimbs or extra fingers. Check the suggestions for ideas.**\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **What is a \u201cNegative Embedding\u201d?**\n\n**Negative embeddings are used in the negative prompt field, but they are\nactually trained models created from images. Bad images. Images of things you\nwant to avoid, like mangled arms and extra fingers.**\n\n**Here is a tutorial:  **\n\n[**https://wiki.monai.art/tutorials/negative_embeddings**](/en/tutorials/negative_embeddings)\n\n\n\n## \u00b6 _**Initial Images**_\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **What does using an \"initial image\" do?**\n\n**Using an initial image gives the AI an image to render from. This can be\nanything from a photo to a simple sketch. You can upload an image from your\nstorage, from Unsplash, from an in-app sketch you make, from a URL, or from a\nprevious render.  **\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **What is \"Unsplash\"?**\n\n**Unsplash is a website that provides a large collection of free, high\nresolution images that can be used for personal or commercial purposes. The\nplatform is powered by a community of photographers who contribute their own\nphotos for others to use. Unsplash has become a popular resource for\ndesigners, bloggers, and anyone needing high-quality images.  **\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **Is the seed still relevant if you use an initial image?**\n\n**Yes. The seed image is still used, even with an initial image. Changing the\nseed will give you a different result, depending on prompt strength.    **\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **What does the \"prompt strength\" slider do?**\n\n**When you use an initial image, the AI still considers the input from your\ntext prompt AND the seed. Increasing the Prompt Strength tells the AI to put\nmore importance on the input from the prompt and seed, and the output will\nlook less like the initial image. Decreasing prompt strength will make the\noutput look more like the initial image.  **\n\n**Here is a tutorial: ", "start_char_idx": 3595, "end_char_idx": 7159, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a8c9d5f-1880-49d3-8574-464b94f39031": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a8c9d5f-1880-49d3-8574-464b94f39031", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3244a9c-f63f-49f8-b244-189248a98aee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a81cbf07832a16cd83b285775df0a82c1dc7dee4b6bc2ddee9781957978fb06f"}, "2": {"node_id": "d3756a98-edbf-4ee7-8f17-d65af0c3814c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "11291fe9d49706f28a7cd2427aa8e0c45ddf971795f2e4283985b6c4a48b23bd"}, "3": {"node_id": "f5c6ad1d-9b2d-4a02-9055-54ae6cdc6424", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9d37c013c315827124aeae7af8838fbedea8260af65a9f5b0cb04e3292f8dd66"}}, "hash": "b8db435351e8f62bd9cc47a29009afd721424b9cf4040ca947a35777c7697e4c", "text": "look more like the initial image.  **\n\n**Here is a tutorial:  **\n\n[**https://wiki.monai.art/en/tutorials/initial_images**](/en/tutorials/initial_images)\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **What is \"Inpainting\"?**\n\n**Use Inpainting to fix or change something in your artwork.

Prompt weighting is a\npowerful tool that allows you to add weight or importance to a word or words\nin your prompt that may otherwise be ignored.  **\n\n**Here's an example where I wanted to create a mosaic design:**\n\n![](/giant_pink_robot_7ba13.jpg) |  ![](/giant_pink_robot_9b15c.jpg)  \n---|---  \n**Prompt:**  \ngiant pint robot in the ocean, surrounded by ocean waves, mosaic art |\n**Prompt:**  \ngiant pink robot in the ocean, surrounded by ocean waves, (mosaic art:1.3)  \n  \n**In the example on the left, the AI gave the robot a subtle mosaic texture,\nbut there is no mosaic in the background. Once I added prompt weighting, as\nshown in the example on the right, the AI created a true mosaic design.**\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 How does prompt weighting work?\n\n**Put the word or words you want to weight inside a parenthesis, followed by a\ncolon and a number, like this:**\n\nBeautiful woman in a rose garden, wearing a (purple lace dress:1.2), holding a\n(basket of red roses:1.3)\n\n**The greater the number, the greater the weight. You can go all the way up to\n1.9, but no higher! If you want to reduce the weight of a term, you can use a\nsmaller number, like this:  **\n\nBeautiful woman in a rose garden, at night, (eerie:0.8), insane details,\nrealistic, (dark:1.4)\n\n**In this case, I wanted just a hint of eeriness, but more than none.  **\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 Is there another way to do prompt weighting?\n\n**Yes. You can also increase or decrease the weight of a term by adding\nplusses or minuses, like this:**\n\nBeautiful woman in a rose garden, wearing a (purple lace dress)++, at", "start_char_idx": 10660, "end_char_idx": 13893, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "602be468-88ac-49fa-ae3d-5a463923401b": {"__data__": {"id_": "602be468-88ac-49fa-ae3d-5a463923401b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3244a9c-f63f-49f8-b244-189248a98aee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a81cbf07832a16cd83b285775df0a82c1dc7dee4b6bc2ddee9781957978fb06f"}, "2": {"node_id": "f5c6ad1d-9b2d-4a02-9055-54ae6cdc6424", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9d37c013c315827124aeae7af8838fbedea8260af65a9f5b0cb04e3292f8dd66"}}, "hash": "f5c51171b19e8149606a3d6e42fce51d6013f59d4acb0b559688144e1167e0ef", "text": "woman in a rose garden, wearing a (purple lace dress)++, at night,\neerie--, dark++++\n\n**\\+ is equivalent to 1.1; however, ++ is 1.1 x 1.1 or 1.21, which is not\nexactly the same as 1.2  **  \n **Similarly, \u2013 is 0.9 x 0.9 which is 0.81  **  \n **Ergo, the plus/minus method will give slightly different results than the\nnumeric method, UNLESS you used multiple decimal places.**\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 Can I use multiple decimal places?\n\n**Yes.  **\n\nBeautiful woman in a rose garden, wearing a (purple lace dress:1.21), at\nnight, (eerie:0.81), (dark:1.4641)\n\n**Will give the exact same result as the plus/minus example I used above.**\n\n\n\n\n\n# \u00b6 **TIPS**\n\n\n\n## \u00b6 _**Artist\u2019s Names**_\n\n**If you want your work to emulate the style of an artist, add the name of\nthat artist to the end of your prompt.**\n\n**Try adding multiple artists\u2019 names to see a blend of their styles.

Bad images. Images of things you\nwant to avoid, like mangled arms and extra fingers.\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **How do I use them?**\n\nThe negative embeddings we\u2019ve added to MonAI are all listed in a separate\nsection under the suggested negative prompts. That way, you can see which ones\nare available and just tap on one (or more) to add them to the negative prompt\nfield.\n\nNegative embeddings often have some impact on aesthetics - composition, color\n- but they are mainly used for human anatomy. If you are trying to generate an\nanimal, you may be better off **without**  a negative embedding.\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **Which Negative Embedding should I use?**\n\nSome negative embeddings are geared towards anime, while others are designed\nfor photorealism. Some are made to go with specific AI models. You can use an\nanime negative embedding with a photorealistic AI model, but the results MIGHT\nhave more defined lines (like anime) and look less photorealistic. All the\nnegative embeddings seem to work well with anime.\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **Why do embeddings take up so much character space?**\n\nThe negative prompt field allows 150 tokens. This is illustrated in characters\n(0/500). **easynegative**  only uses 2 tokens, but **ng_deepnegative_v1_75t**\nuses 75. This means, if you use **ng_deepnegative_v1_75t**  you will be using\nmore of the negative prompt space that the sum of the characters used.\n\nMonAI creates a rough estimate of the amount of characters a negative\nembedding would use, but these are ESTIMATES ONLY, and they are high\nestimates. The chart below shows how many tokens each negative embedding takes\nso that you can compare them to each other.\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 **What\u2019s with all the Unspeakable Horrors?**\n\nThe v stands for vector. The higher the number, the more powerful it is, and\nthe more tokens it uses. Does that mean it\u2019s better? I\u2019ve gotten better\nresults with 24v and 32v, but 64v is also popular.\n\nThe lower vector versions are better for photorealistic images and for AI\nmodels that already produce high-quality results. The higher vector versions\ntend to change the image style significantly. Still, they can achieve\noutstanding results.\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 Negative Embeddings Chart\n\n**Negative Embedding**\n\n|\n\n**Specialty**\n\n|\n\n**Tokens**\n\n|\n\n**Note**  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \neasynegative | Anime | 2 | More muted colors  \nng_deepnegative_v1_75t | Anime | 75 | More vibrant colors  \nUnspeakable-Horrors-16v | Photorealism | 16 |  \nUnspeakable-Horrors-24v | Photorealism | 24 | Recommended for Deliberate and\nRealistic Vision  \nUnspeakable-Horrors-32v | Photorealism | 32 | Recommended for Deliberate and\nRealistic Vision  \nUnspeakable-Horrors-48v | Photorealism | 48 |  \nUnspeakable-Horrors-64v | Photorealism | 64 |  \nbad-artist | Universal | 2 | Suggest adding \u201csketch\u201d \u201cpainting\u201d or \u201cphoto\u201d in\nfront of, as in \u201cphoto by bad-artist\u201d  \nbad-artist-anime | Anime | 2 | Suggest adding \u201csketch\u201d or \u201cdrawing\u201d in front\nof, as in \u201csketch by bad artist-anime\u201d  \nbadhandv4 | Hands | 4 |  \nnegative_hand-neg | Hands | 8 |  \nbad_prompt_version2-neg | Anime | 8 | Popular for anatomy and hands  \nverybadimagenegative_v1.3 | Anime | 12 | Popular for anatomy and hands ", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3324, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "faf724ba-8eb2-420f-a1de-555e7865b78c": {"__data__": {"id_": "faf724ba-8eb2-420f-a1de-555e7865b78c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f0d8dd4-c19e-4e57-a49a-37d788895de7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e6bee13102a4183cf409511bf476ae4e9a0ad01e7de5dd9c0682d4db10fae2ec"}, "2": {"node_id": "03c1bb83-f406-4366-a93c-cb09ae10dec4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d55a33891c6f67f1238cbc38d3e54b067bfb7e31981f0d5c9bae93a35d7d5dc8"}}, "hash": "293ad56c480d9bfdd340e1ef7ed81ba67bc26264ab1d134b54feb2f1c70ad5af", "text": "| Anime | 12 | Popular for anatomy and hands  \nbeauty512 | Universal | 6 |  \nFastNegativeEmbedding | Universal | 52 |  \nFastNegativeEmbeddingStrong | Universal | 52 |  \nbad-picture-chill-75v | Universal | 9 |  \nrealisticvision-negative-embedding | Realistic Vision 2 | 75 |  \nBadDream | DreamShaper 6 | 69 | Made for \u201cDreamShaper style\u201d  \nUnrealisticDream | DreamShaper 6 | 37 | Made for realistic images", "start_char_idx": 3279, "end_char_idx": 3683, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b49bd3cd-eb7d-4c68-b60f-a6a2a633b0ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "b49bd3cd-eb7d-4c68-b60f-a6a2a633b0ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8b7a998b-a74b-4e1f-b7c6-9817fbd84599", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "75f3b597851907dd521f438f98d888d7c0d946c91c7e7673250adb1edffe3ca0"}, "3": {"node_id": "1c55e2fd-6220-4731-bcaa-30915c82be57", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "471d6c7c48cc0c539055164d23547f919e0014b45821b31dfb7bfce8a8278dd1"}}, "hash": "65f1a65c1c6a2e7031e55da814e9a9d5d8674adb7365f2e96fa498dad2a45635", "text": "## \u00b6 _Prompt Weighting_\n\n\n\n### \u00b6 What is prompt weighting?\n\n**Sometimes the AI will ignore parts of your prompt.
