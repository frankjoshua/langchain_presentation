<h2 style="text-align:center;"><i>Tokens</i></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">Why is there a token limit?</h3>
<p>There is a limit to the amount of text MonAI can process in a prompt. That limit is expressed in tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">What, exactly, is a token?</h3>
<p>A token is a character or sequence of characters that represents a single unit of meaning. A word might equal 1 token, or it might be 2 or more.&nbsp;<br>Tree = 1 token<br>House = 1 token<br>Treehouse = 2 tokens<br>Navigate = 2 token<br>Circumnavigate = 4 tokens</p>
<p>It's hard to predict how many tokens any given prompt will use, even for the token counter. The counter may be off on its estimation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">What is the token limit for MonAI?</h3>
<p><strong>150 tokens is the current limit.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">Why do tokens exist?</h3>
<p>Stable Diffusion changes words (which it doesn't understand) into tokens (which it does understand), and then into numbers. It generates art based on those numbers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">Why do some embeddings have so many tokens?</h3>
<p>An embedding is actually an AI model trained from images. Some of them have fewer tokens and some have more, depending on how the embedding was made. MonAI currently has a selection of negative embeddings and more information about them <a href="tutorials/negative_embeddings">HERE</a>.&nbsp;</p>
