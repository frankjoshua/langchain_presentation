Jump to Content Secondary menu Location Calendar Community Covid-19HomeAbout ▼About UsEquipmentOrganizationMembershipPressclose this panelSpaceProjectsPhotos You are hereHome Volunteer FAQ Volunteer FAQ Q: What are my volunteer requirements as a full member?A: The requirements for volunteer time have been codified in the "Arch Reactor Standing Rules" document and was approved by a majority vote of Arch Reactors full members. Currently, the requirement is stated as follows:Section 4.a.ii -"A full member must perform an average of 2 hours per month of volunteer service for Arch Reactor over a rolling 12 month period;"Section 4.a.iv -"When a full member's eligibility expires he or she must forfeit their access to the space and all property of Arch Reactor to the Sergeant at Arms."The Arch Reactor Standing Rules can be found in it's entirety at https://archreactor.org/about/organizationQ: What is the deadline for having my volunteer hours submitted?A: Since we started tracking volunteer hours at the start of April 2017, the Board of Directors has decided to stick with an "April to April" schedule at this time. Therefor the current deadline is April 1stQ: How do I submit volunteer hours?A: Simply send an email to "volunteer@archreactor.org". In the body of the email, simply list the tasks you worked on and the amount of time spent on each. Your hours will be briefly reviewed and then your recorded volunteer hours will be updated.Alternatively, you may also submit your volunteer hours using the sign-in tablet found near the main entrance to the space.You may view your current volunteer hours by logging into archreactor.org and selecting "Volunteer Hours" under the "MEMBERS" tab.Q: Do specific jobs or task have to be pre-approved to be counted towards my volunteer hours?A: Not really. We are trying to keep things as open ended as possible. The overall goal here is to make Arch Reactor a better community for everyone, and allow everyone to contribute however they can. The general rule of thumb is: If it in some way benefits Arch Reactor, it probably counts.If you are still unsure if something you helped counts, submit the time anyway. Odds are it will be accepted. Worse case scenario is someone may ask you how what you did is beneficial to Arch Reactor, but at least the board knows you are making an effort.Q: What happens if I don't meet the volunteer requirements of full membership?A: If for some reason a member does't meet the annual 24 hours of volunteer time, then membership status will no longer be considered in "Good Standing". The result of which will mean that electronic key access to the space will be disabled until the member is once again in good standing.If a full member is in danger of falling out of good standing within the next 30 days, that member will receive an email alert so action can be taken to avoid losing access to the space.Q: Will I be able to regain access to the space if my membership has fallen out of good standing due to not meeting the volunteer requirements?A: Absolutely. Simply show up when the space is open for events and offer to help out. Or if you are unable to make a specific event, contact the Sergeant at Arms to see if there is anything else you can help out with.Once you have fulfilled the required volunteer hours, your membership status will again be in good standing.Q: What kinds of activities would be considered "volunteering"?A: The general rule of thumb is: If it in some way benefits Arch Reactor, it probably counts. That means there is no definitive list, but the options are endless.If you need some suggestions, here is an incomplete list of things you can do:Fill a volunteer staff positionHelping build-out the spaceHelp clean the space. Except if it's your own mess of course. Cleaning up after yourself is just expected.Participate in public outreach events such as First Friday, Fire and Ice, and the Murmuration FestivalTeaaching a class.Research and/or write a grant for Arch Reactor.

This vision sensor is low cost for under 100 dollars. The sensor tracks color hues at a whopping 50 frames per second. If you’re interested, you can find more information about Pixy at theirwiki page.There was three robots built in total and were constructed in March of 2015, They are in the process of being redesigned addeding stronger bases and new features.This project sprang up from the idea that Arch Reactor members often go to event to get the community involved in making and repairing. I thought robots would be a nice way to draw individuals to the table, and get them interested in robotics, would be an interactive display. This display would feature three robots that could track colored balls on a transportable table. To create this project I filled out an Arch Reactor Awesome Grant and I was awarded the grant by Arch Reactor to build the robots. It was easy to apply, and I encourage more members to do so. I am so grateful for the Awesome Grant as this project would be outside my budget without it.Below is a link to the related documents for this project.Grant proposalFeatures include:Velcro attached battery packs for quick swapping out and chargingLi-ion battery packs rated at 2800mAH at 7.2 volts.

This is ArchReactor's effort at a DIY Telepresence bot build from easily, and cheaply, obtainable materials, such as an Arduino, an unused PC and webcam, and various other spare parts.The starting point of the robot is a power wheelchairbase obtained from craigslist. The original plan was to tap into the chair's own controller, but this proved quite complex, and in trying the controller was damaged. A replacement controller was rather expensive, so we opted to instead get a common motor controller to directly drive the motors. The basic process is this:Strip the wheelchair to its basics.Remove the electric brakes from the motors (more on this later)Re-wire the 2 12V batteries from serial (24V) to paralell (12V) to increase runtime.Add a "pole" to bring the monitor and webcam up to standing eye level.Add supporting electronics.Write software.We were able to separate the seat mount from the seat and re-use that for the monitor pole. This also allows easy removal of the pole for transport. The brakes were a minor challenge, they work opposite from bike or car brakes in that they are applied by default with a strong spring and use a strong electromagnet to release them. This is needed in a device made to carry 300lbs so that it won't roll down a hill if the battery dies while it's being used. We're not putting a lot of weight on the base so the motor gearing is plenty to keep it from rolling, and the brakes use a lot of power, which we'll need to run a PC and monitor. Guides for accessing the brakes are available on-line for most wheel chairs, and the design of ours allowed simply removing them and reassembling the gearbox.The PicturesView album on ImgurThe partsHere's the parts we used. Most of this is substitutable for equivalents or more appropriate parts for your build. See photos at end of this page.Pronto wheelchairSabertooth 2x25 motor controllerArduino Mega (an Uno will also work with the current code)ITead Sensor shield (a proto shield would work fine)several high power plugs salvaged from power backup batteries (such as APC UPS)a common light switch and box for a motor power "kill switch"an AMD E-series powered NetTop media PC.a 15" LCDlength of iron pipe threaded on both ends with "floor plates" for mounting12VDC to 120VAC power inverter to run the PCWifi-N router (the Nettop's wifi was found unreliable, and this also allows us to demo when no internet is available.IR receiver and remote salvaged from a non-functional digital picture frame"power bus" terminal stripkeyboard mounting trayBuild is fairly straightforward, mount to look like the robot you want, and wire as per best practices and motor controler instructions. Our is designed so that th pole, and PC and monitor and kill switch, easily unplug to separate from the base. The kill switch unplugging means that the motors cannot accidentally be energized durring transport. The motor electronics also easy unplug so that the motors or the controller can easily be remove for maintaince and debugging.Notes: The AMD E-series is just barely sufficient for the task. A laptop would simplify the design and lower the power profile for better runtimes, we did not have one on-hand.The SoftwareThe system use WebRTCso that no special software or client plugin is needed, just a new enough Chrome or Firefox browser, including Chrome for Android.Basic design is this:Server component in Node.js that handles commands to the Arduino via USB and negotiates WebRTC connections using Socket.io.Web interface using JQueryto handle robot driving controlThe Node server only brokers the WebRTC connections, so it's fairly lightweight (keep this in mind for later). The WebRTC standard implemented in the browers talks directly to each other, so it's not difficult to make go on a LAN, but getting it to work behind firewalls requires something called an ICE server. Our current code does not use an ICE server and so only works on LANs, which is OK for now as we demonstrate the technology and improve drivability. It's actually quite difficult to remotely drive it now, and the wheelchair base is powerful enough to hurt someone if things go wrong.The Node and browser code is heavily based on the WebRTC Codelabwalkthrough. Additional messaging channels and serial IO code were added to drive the robot.Our current code, and installation instructions, are available at ArchReactor's GitHub page. It's been tested on Windows 8.1 x64 and Ubuntu Linux 14.04 x86. Please use the github "issues" features to report any problems. UPDATE: As of 5/12/2015 rRaspberryPi is also tested for the Node server only. Raspbians Node is too old, and the latest Node is too new. A manual install of Node 0.10.16 is the only version verified to work due to ARM compatability with the Serialport module.The FuturePerformance and power use are both issues. Since the node server doesn't use a lot of resources the plan is to use a small linux system, such as Raspberry PI or Intel Edison, for the server and robot control (possibly removing the Arduino too), then use an Android tablet for the "head". This would also make it easier to add a pan and tilt mechanism to the head so it can look around without driving. Being able to look down and see the wheels will make remote driving a lot easier and less risky.

Jump to Content Secondary menu Location Calendar Community Covid-19HomeAbout ▼About UsEquipmentOrganizationMembershipPressclose this panelSpaceProjectsPhotos You are hereHome Build Yourself a Pallet Pool Build Yourself a Pallet Pool So here we are in the 2020 summer pandemic and pools are sold out everywhere. Here’s our homemade solution. We only had to purchase a 19x29’ tarp for $60 and one 2” ratchet strap. Our pool ended up 14.5’ x 8’ x 36” deep. It did take us 2 prior attempts to figure out everything that needs to be reinforced and footing placements to support the 2,804 pounds of water.Supplies – Pallets, tarp, 3”deck screws, 2” ratchet straps, pavers, mulch and some left over wood for bracing.Pallets can be found all over the place. Our design used 12, half found and saved at a friend’s work. The second half we found behind some strip mall places and behind Harbor Freight. We did spend a day prepping pallets. Remove all the protruding nails and populate any missing boards. The topsides, which will be the inside walls cannot have spacing that exceeds 3 inches.Our design was 2 pallets on the sides and 4 pallets on the long walls. We screwed the pallets together with three 3” deck screws at each connection.Followed by ratchet strapping the middle to secure the shape.The flatter the ground the better. We had no choice and had to work with the slope of our yard. We add footings under each pallet joint on the low side and filled in with mulch. If there is any noticeable slope the pool will walk downhill. We ended up having to brace our pool to a nearby parking pad. The low board to stop the walking and a mid brace to help with the leaning. There’s also a 2x6 we put down the middle of the long wall to help the deck screws.Moral of the story. You can’t put enough bracing around a pool. We also put another smaller ratchet strap along the bottom to help with the walking issue.Filling does take about 8 hours with a hose. Luckily, we have unmetered water and cool neighbors. So with 2 hoses we’re at 36” in 4 hours. We mulched the inside border to ensure the tarp wouldn’t slip underneath. We screwed the tarp grommets on our long (and higher side) to the outside midpoint of the pallets. You want to carefully monitor the first few inches and ensure there no large pallet spaces that allows the tarp to have a hernia. If you monitor it well enough you can see this happening and pull the tarp tighter. After about the halfway mark the tarp is well set and you can add a second strap around the top to hold and slightly clean up the tarp and it’s folds.We classed up the pool a little (maybe very little) with a 4’ reed skirt from Menards. Every drain and refill we make it a little better. The next one we’ll add some PVC fitting to create ports for filtration. Then put on a 2x6 top frame and build some small stairs and deck.

Watch the Arch Reactor calendar the month prior to Easter every year as we host annual in-house Egg-Days!SpaceEgg_2019We offer free classes/decorating-sessions every spring, often in March. Watch for announcements about AR Egg-Days every spring!AR Egg-Day(s) Info:Pysanky are decorated using whole, raw chicken eggs and hot beeswax melted over candle flames. This is not a craft for small, exciteable children, though many childrenhave successfully decorated beautiful eggs. Any child decorating will need to be closely supervised and assisted by a parent, please. Safety will be paramount as we are using live flames in this craft. There is no charge to decorate eggs and everything to decorate will be supplied. If you appreciate this class and have the means you are welcome to make a modest donation to Arch Reactor. It takes most beginners approximately 3 hours to complete one Pysanka but there is a lot of "waiting" time so it's often possible to compete two eggs in approximately 4 hours. During AR Egg-Days, people are welcome to make multiple eggs and/or may work on egg(s) over multiple sessions, but please be sure to complete your eggs by the end of the last day. The times listed are when an "instructor" will be on-site but the supplies will be available whenever Arch Reactor is open during the posted date-range.Interested in learning more about decorating Pysanky?

Keep up the good work! We support you!Readmore... Face Shield Initiative STL [field_thumbnail]In response to the quick and drastic needs of our local healthcare workers, the community of St. Louis makers and makerspaces have united to help fabricate much-needed hardware for nurses, EMTs and doctors.Led by maker David Cervantes, Face Shield Initiative STL is composed of volunteer community leaders from MADE Makerspace, Inventor Forge, and Arch Reactor. Together we are pooling the maker resources at hand to help the 1st responder teams, doctors, nurses, and medical staff by fabricating face shields. There is an overwhelming demand or face shields used to protect the facemasks in which medical/responder staff has a finite quantity.We are responding to this demand by activating local makerspaces and individual makers with access to 3D printers to print an open-source harness made by Prusa Research. Volunteer makers with access to laser cutters or Cricuts are helping by cutting out the transparent PETG face shield film. Volunteers are also aiding by shuttling the materials required to print the harness, the film, and delivery to those in need.We have now pooled over 15 printers and 6 laser cutters so we can pump out our initial goal of 300 face shields for Barnes-Jewish Hospital. We want to help as many health care workers and hospitals as we can. There has been an overwhelming request to help other medical centers and cities; we want to help as many health care workers andhospitals as we can. The St. Louis community has already donated over $800 in funds to help supplement our material and transportation costs.We are restricted by time, material resources, and budgets. This entire operation is a bootstrap effort; every volunteer has used their personal funds and resources in an uncertain economic climate to help others. We are making progress obtaining the PETG face shields, but still require a solid supply. While our maker community continues torun their 3D printers around the clock, we will quickly run out of PETG and PLA filament, and the elastic bands used to aid securing the shields will run low.We delivered the first batch of prototypes today, March 22nd, for product refinement to doctors, nurses and first responders. We plan to begin our crowd-sourced mass production efforts by the end of this week.

It's allegedly the perfect holiday where trying to get a group of techies, tinkerers, and free thinkers to show up at a specific time and place for any kind of holiday party is more difficult than herding cats.Celebrating Hacktivus with the traditional Hacktivus Gift Exchange:- To sign up to participate in the Hacktivus Gift Exchange, fill out the Google Form from January 1st-10th.https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdnxQRVstK0m7wYyZiIs6HWSBKht5xRIMyVj5mjpBCU_7t0TA/viewform- Everyone that signs up will eventually get an email with the name of another random member that also signed up for the gift exchange. Keep it a secret though, that's part of the fun! Oh, and I promise not to just pair everyone up with my name!- Make, hack, re-gift, or purchase a gift for the member who's name you were given. Try to keep the spending limit at around $20.- Wrap the gift to the best of your gift-wrapping capabilities and label it with the member's name that you were given.- Deliver the wrapped gift at Arch Reactor and place it by the customarily decorated Hacktivus Robot. It will vigilantly protect your gift until the gift's intended recipient can come by and pick it up.- Once you've delivered your gift, please respond to the email you received so the organizers can notify the gift's recipient that their gift is waiting for them.- Now wait anxiously for the notification email informing you when a Hacktivus gift has been delivered for you!Readmore...

We don't have all of the equipment that TechShop had, but we do have a laser cutter, 3D printers, and a variety of woodworking and metalworking tools.Please see our calendar for times when our space will be open and feel free to come get a tour and meet members at any event.

Like most things in life right now, we are in need of making some adjustments. The board, along with several active members' input, have unanimously decided there is not a practical way to hold elections as they are traditionally conducted this year. As those of you who attended the virtual business meeting tonight already know, we have put in a lot of work to come up with a process that will allow us to hold elections online this year in a practical fashion. We do take our commitment to our bylaws seriously. However, we feel this is the best option and it is better than not holding elections or asking our members to do multiple votes over an extended timeframe and managing that process.The 2021 election process will move forward as documented below:Nominations for Board PositionsNomination's start tonight and run until January 18th.Submit nominations using the following Google Form:https://forms.gle/f2jXgUvpayfWQHNq5Current nominees can be viewed from this spreadsheet:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X30XALy9gc-qvFYa0uWAiQaIFGiRezgEVkoUZfKEVPY/edit?usp=sharingGiven the unique situation of this year's elections, the decision has been made to suspend the nomination of members to multiple positions for this election. It is simply not logistically or technically feasible to do so and still conduct an efficient and timely election online. Members may only be nominated for a single board position.If you have been nominated, but wish to decline the nomination, email the current board and we'll strike-through your name from the list. Your name will remain on the list during the nomination period, so others who may nominate you can see that it has been declined and will not nominate you again.Those who have been nominated will be contacted by a board member to confirm they are aware and accept the nominated.Candidate DebatesDebates will occur online on January 19th.Candidates will be presenting through a Jisti video conference, much in the same manner that it occurs during business meetings.If you are a nominee, and you are unable to participate in the virtual debates, please contact either the President or Vice President so we can make accommodations.If there are technical reasons that a candidate cannot participate in the Jitsi conference, then accommodations will be made to get the candidate access to the conference, arrange a voice call, or rely text messages if absolutely necessary.Rather than stressing the capabilities of Jitsi by having everyone join a single video conference, the debates will be live streamed on Youtube.This will allow for more people to view the debate simultaneously.It will also provide a separate chat for the membership to discuss among themselves and ask questions of the candidates.You may also email questions to the President or Vice President in advance, if you are unable to watch the live event, but would still like to try and have a question answered. There is no guarantee that time will permit every question to be answered.The candidates themselves will be on their honor to not participate in the Youtube live stream while the debates are taking placeThe video to the Youtube stream will also be recorded for later viewing, and made available to the voting membership.Links to the recorded debate will be included in all subsequent communications regarding the election.Derek will moderate the debates, as he has declared he will not be running for the board this year and the duties fall within the purview of the role of president.Joe, as Vice President, will handle production of the debates, managing the audio, video stream, and monitoring the chat for questions.As usual, debates will consist of:Each candidate takes up to 5 minutes to make a campaign statement towards the position they have been nominated for.This will be followed by each candidate taking up to 5 minutes to answer various questions from the membership.As the debates are being held online, and predate the election, the private discussion time among voting members does not need to immediately follow. Though it is permitted to occur in the chat.Derek and Joe will conduct technical rehearsal for the debates on January 13th. Members and nominees are welcome to participate, but it is not required. We will be simply working out technical issues that may arise during the debates.Election VotingVoting will open the very next day, January 20th, and run through January 31st.This year voting will be conducted online. We will be making use of OpavoteOpavote is an online election platform designed for organizations like ours.Of the various options that were reviewed, it is the simplest, cleanest, and cheapest solution that meets our immediate needs.Every voting member will be emailed a unique link to cast their vote. Please confirm that your email address on file is current.Voting will still remain anonymous. The platform does not allow us to correlate the unique URL links to individuals.Reminder emails will be automatically sent out every 3 days during the election period to ensure we reach the widest number of voters possible.If for technical reasons you are unable to cast your vote with the platform, contact the current board for assistance or for accommodations to be made.Election ResultsElected winners will be notified February 1st.February 2nd will be the General Business meeting.Will include the transition of the 2020 Board to the 2021 Board.Election results and data will be made available to the membership.

NOMcon Virtual Conference going on this week until Saturday! Here's what you're missing: Posted on Thursday, Jun 4th, 2020 Wow! What an amazing NOMCON we’ve had so far. We started Day 1 off with afantastic Keynote by Dr. Leah Hanes from Two Bit Circus Foundation, celebratedthe amazing Infy Maker Award recipients, and launched into a full day of incrediblepanels, roundtables, workshops, spark sessions and fireside chats. We finished ourincredible programming for the day with a discussion of our Core Principles and howmaker organizations can begin the important work of putting them into action. And ofcourse, we still had a Happy Hour - our cocktail hour was a nice break to see eachother’s faces, enjoy some fun conversations (what are YOU binge watching thesedays?), and to experience a little of the maker love that we all feel during in-personNOMCON.But, as with any event, there were also some bumps in the road - and yesterday,that was the magical mystery of the disappearing Zoom links. In true Scooby Doofashion, we figured out the culprit, and we are making sure we don’t have a repeatof that technical glitch for the remainder of our conference. We are sorry for anyinconvenience for our attendees, speakers, exhibitors, and sponsors. We aregrateful to all of you who attended yesterday - for your patience, grace, andkindness during the technical issues, and for sticking with us in spite of them. And intrue maker fashion, many of you jumped in as last minute volunteers (with joy!),because, well, that’s what we, as a maker community do (we fix things!) - for that,we are especially grateful.Now who’s excited for Day 2?We are! Today’s Keynote comes from Dr. Paul Bunje from Conservation X Labs,who will speak to us about "Empowering Everyone to End the Sixth MassExtinction". Don’t go the way of the dinosaurs - join us! That will be followed by evenmore exciting programming including some special sessions from the Department ofEnergy about their new Geothermal Prize, including how innovative uses of additivemanufacturing in geothermal could save the day! And of course, we’ll have anothercocktail hour with breakouts and fun topics to discuss (and possibly games!).Finally, don’t forget to visit our virtual exhibit booths from XPrize, MatterHackers andShopBot as well as our Film Screening of Me and My Robot. There is a lot of greatinformation, live session info and contests, and an absolutely great movie for you toview.MatterHackers will be having a daily giveaway drawing for attendees that addthe MatterHatter booth to their schedule. Today’s (Thursday’s) giveaway isa $100 MatterHackers Gift Card!

Positive data goes to pin A0 on the Arduino. Recommend consulting the datasheet with your specific sensor - I used SSCDRRN030PDAA5, but significant construction benefits could be found using a sensor with a larger connector. I recommend staying with the SSC series - the NSC series, for example, is uncalibrated and outputs a raw signal, while the SSC series outputs e.g. 0-5 V. Slight changes to the math in the code might be necessary. FYI - The math in the code has been optimized by using integer math.I used the Perma-Proto quarter-sized breadboard pcb to connect wires to the Honeywell sensor. I cut another one in half and used it for pin breakout on the Arduino board, as well as a place for the 7805 voltage regulator. The voltage regulator was used to drop the 12VDC commonly found in cars to 5VDC for the Arduino and Honeywell sensor. Since the voltage was now regulated, it was connected directly to the 5V pin of the Arduino board.Theory and assembly of the i2c/SPI character LCD backpack and LCD screen can be found here: https://learn.adafruit.com/i2c-spi-lcd-backpack. The code I used was pretty much copy and pasted from there, using the same wire connections.The i2c LCD backpack has been optimized by using the LiquidTWI library, shown here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpwqGJwn1FY (link to library is in video description)I used the JST SM plugs from Adafruit to connect the arduino and LCD screen circuits for ease of installation into the car. I used the Waterproof Polarized 4-Wire connector for the connection to the actual boost gauge circuit, since it was in the engine bay.There is an option in the code for personal preference or debugging: on line 14, the code is:boolean minmax = false; //flag for boost graph or max and min boostThe flag “false” can flipped to “true” to display the minimum (read: vacuum) and maximum boost levels since the gauge was last turned on.I used an SLA to build the cases for everything - there is a box for the pressure sensor board, a box for the arduino, and a box for the display. The display box is a little small for my display, I had to widen it by about 1 mm all around. I also filled the pressure sensor board box with an electronics potting epoxy to protect the parts from any weather the car might see.

Some members are already heading different projects, but if there is an area you would like to help out or take a lead in, you could help tremendously! There are also many small projects that can be taken up by anybody, listed on the Space Improvement Projects page. ***Arch Reactor is a shared space where creativity and ingenuity may reach critical levels! Our 5000 ft2 reaction chamber contains a Shop full of equipment, a Lab to work on your projects, a Classroom to enrich your mind, and a Lounge where ideas can fuse together. Our space is a community workshop where members learn, collaborate, and bring ideas to life. Our members keep everything running, and our community is always working to improve the space.Our space does not have any staff to keep it open for guaranteed hours, but most members open the space up for anyone to come by (check our space status switch on the front page). Check our calendar, but it is almost always open Sunday and Tuesday nights, and anyone can come by for a tour, help with a project, or just to hang out. Become a supporting or full member to gain use of the shop, 24-7 access, and other benefits! Lab AreaThe Lab area features a lot of table space for everyone to work on their projects in a low-dust environment. There are also many tools for working on electronics and other clean projects, including a soldering station, vinyl cutter, 3D printers, and an 80W laser cutter. There are shelves where members can keep a private tote, and an assortment of salvaged and donated parts available for anyone to use.ClassroomThe classroom seats over 20 students in a clean and quiet space conducive to learning. It is not completely finished, but it is functional and we have been using it to hold classes. We currently have two large flat panel displays on the walls for presentations. We expect in the future to add a large projector screen, white boards, a wireless microphone system, and a live streaming camera all available for any class.LoungeThe lounge will be a cozy area for everyone to relax and socialize in. We currently have a fridge full of soda and beer and freezer with pizza, and we hope to soon have a full kitchenette. There are couches and comfy chairs, a MAME machine, and soon there will be a console gaming area as well.ShopMany of us urbanites don't have garages to tinker in, which is why we have a fully featured shop in our space, including saws, vices, grinders, lathes, drill presses, planers, welders, kilns, forges and all the tools we need to create. Some tools are owned by the organization, but most are owned by our members and shared. Use of the shop is restricted to members, and you should always be trained before using a new tool.Help keep the space clean at our monthly business meeting by participating in the Cleaning Lottery

We entered this in the Hackaday prize and won the Citizen Scientist round. This added 1000dollars of prize money that we used to upgrade to a more improved microscope that is currently in the process of being built.We are building a low cost IoT microscope based on the Raspberry Pi 3. Using easily changeable glass objectives. This microscope will provides various magnification. (40x, 100x, 400x). The microscope will scan the specimen on the x and y axis and stitch the images together to create a large and very detailed image that can be reviewed on a internet connected phone, tablet or computer. We will be making the design as low cost as possible so that anyone in the world has access to a very powerful digital microscope. Citizen scientists from around the world will soon have a new powerful tool to aid in future discoveries.The Raspberry Pi 3 will provide the necessary I/O pins for control of the stepper drivers and Pi camera, and will also facilitate the connection to multiple devices via a WiFi connection. We are looking into software algorithms that will stitch the images together on the Pi as it scans the target. Since it also has a built -in full size HDMI port, you can also simply hook the microscope to a TV or computer screen to view the camera.For more information please visit the Hackaday page athttps://hackaday.io/project/11429-internet-of-things-microscope Posted by Apollo Timbers on Friday, October 14th, 2016 Filed under | More Latest Project Posts Build Yourself a Pallet Pool LIQUID NITROGEN ICE CREAM RECIPE FROM FIRE AND ICE Laser Engrave a Photo Basic Cutting Board Cardweaving Agenda No upcoming events

Jump to Content Secondary menu Location Calendar Community Covid-19HomeAbout ▼About UsEquipmentOrganizationMembershipPressclose this panelSpaceProjectsPhotos You are hereHome Laser Cutter Guide Laser Cutter Guide Using the Laser cutters...Arch Reactor's two laser cutters can engrave images and can cut out shapes. It's not at all uncommon to perform both tasks, though some material that can be engraved cannot be cut by the laser. Document preparation is key, as is selecting the proper power and speed settings. Please be prepared to ask for assistance and please TEST!The two lasers are similar in terms of what items they will cut and engrave, but they are dramatically different in size and have several differencesWhat materials can be used with the lasers::WoodAcrylic - use Cast rather than Extruded acrylic if at all possible. They are manufactured at different temperatures and Extruded acrylic will often crack and craze, especially if exposed to any chemicalsPaper - go fast and use low power, but it can produce Spectacular results! (Niels is the expert with paper)Leather - depending on how it is finished, some finishes will react badly in the laser, and leather has a tendency to flame. (perhaps try masking with tape?) (Sam has recently engraved and cut leather beautifully)Glass - non-tempered - can supposedly be engraved but cannot be cut (not sure anyone at AR has tried this yet. please be careful and Share Your Results!) (There are many lasered pieces of pyrex on the internet - please research before trying)Anodyzed and Powder-Coated metals - Cannot be cut, but they can be engraved which removes the coating to expose the bare metal beneathMarble and Granite - Both Bob S and Myles F have the most experience with these materialsCeramic Tile - Cannot be cut, but the top finish can be etched off. Recommend color-filling the engraving.Rubber - Can stink, but can make awesome rubber stamps! Check with Niels or Diane for more infoWhat materials cannot be used with the laser::Anything containing chlorine. Not only are the fumes poisonous, they will destroy the components of the laser itself. If you are unsure, Google it! (There are ways to test unknown materials - check with Diane)Metals - Metals cannot be cut, though some can be engraved and/or otherwise marked.Tempered glass - Supposedly it will shatterAnything reflective - it will bounce the beam and you could end up burning something across the room by accident (TRULY!) (Some reflective materials can be masked, as with masking tape)Anything too thick to fit in the bed. (at a guess, probably 4-5" thick is the current maximum)LEXAN Polycarbonate does not cut well. Will scorch too much before it cuts. See the sample in the pile of scrap.Preparing your Image::LaserCad (small laser) and ??? (large laser) imports .dxf files. These can be produced out of Corel, Inkscape, and probably several other image programsCorel, Inkscape and others can open/import a variety of other file formats.From within Corel on the small laser computer there is an icon on the taskbar near the top right half of the screen that is a blue square with a white arrow. If you have an image within Corel, click on this icon to take the image directly into LaserCadCorel is not currently installed on the large laser - prepare your image on the small laser computer and transfer over the PWJ5 file via a thumb driveLaserCad can also engrave .bmp files.Engraving photographs can be really awesome but image-preparation is Key. Here's an Instructable for image-processing if you have Adobe Photoshop. The concepts are explained well enough that if you're good at image processing in a different program the concepts might be helpful. http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Laser-Engraving-Photo/?ALLSTEPSWorking within LaserCad::Import (not open) a .DXF file exported from inkscape, corel, illustrator, etc. Make sure you used millimiters when you prepared it. OR open a LaserCad file from before. OR draw your design in LaserCad directly.The blue dot is the "origin" point of the file, the position that the laser-head is when the job is startedYou can change the location of the origin with the X feature. This is located in the toolbar (look for an icon of two small boxes and an arrow pointing to a small dot)You can edit images and add new features within LaserCad, such as drawing circles or boxes or adding lines.There are a series of "shape" icons on the left side of the screen. Choose the desired shape and draw.You can rotate your image, either with arrows or by typing in the degrees of rotation.The different colors in your image are different 'layers'Click and drag or double-click to select a portion of your imageOnce highlighted, click on one of the colored squares on the bottom of the screen to select a colorEach layer can be set to different engraving/cutting settingsThe colors and their settings are displayed in a window on the right side of the screenDouble-click any color to bring up the window to set/verify the settings of each colorSet each color to "Engrave" or "Cut"Set the speed and power values for each sectionIn the Engrave section is a field named "Scan Gap". Typically leave this set to .1There is an option to set "work times". Normally set at "1", if you know you'll need to run multiple passes, you can change that value.There is also an option to "pulse" the laser.You control the order of engraving/cutting operations by arranging the colors in the order you wish them to occur.Set the order by using the "up" and "down" buttons immediately under the color/settings windowIt is recommended to engrave prior to cuttingIt is also recommended to cut small, internal areas of the image before cutting out large shapes.Once your image is ready, click "download" (below the color-selection on the right side) to download your image to the laser (the laser must be turned on)The download box will allow you to set a file-name for your jobThere is an option to set "work times". Normally set at "1", if you know you'll need to run multiple passes, you can change that value (here for all parts, or as above for the individual "color")If you check "auto group engrave" it will engrave small sections of your image separately instead of sweeping across the entire rowDepending on your image, sometimes this will save you time, sometimes it will add a LOT of time to your jobA few notes on Engraving vectored images::Only fully closed objects can be engraved. Even if the starting and ending node are stacked atop each other, if they are not joined, the image will be ignored.Both computers are set to "fill in" areas that will be engraved. Check closely.If you have duplicate images stacked on top of each other that are the same layer/color, they will not engrave properly.If you have asked Corel to "trace" an imported image, sometimes Corel will duplicate lines in the center of an image. Tracing text, for example, may put a double-line in the middle of letters, like the interior loop on the letter "o" for example.If the letter "o" cuts (or is simulated) as a solid circle, check to see that you don't have two interior lines stacked atop each otherEngraving seems to treat each encounter with a layer/color as a toggle on/off switch.If you want to engrave text such that the letters are "etched into" the surface, have the layer set to just the inner and outer lines of each letterIf you want to engrave text such that the background is etched away and the text remains at the original level of the material, draw a "bounding box" (of any shape) around the text.The same applies to images, which can be etched into the surface or you can use a bounding-box to etch away the background, leaving the image raisedWhile engraving, the laser will "overshoot" the edge of the engraved edge.This effectively narrows your allowed image size.If the engraved edge is too close to either the left or right side of the laser bed, you will get a "beyond size" error which might hit mid-way through a job, effectively ruining your runAt speed 300 it's recommended to leave at least 1/2 inch on either side of the field to accommodate this "overshoot"Operating the Small Laser CutterReach around to the power supply located far back on the right side of the machine and flip the green switch.Wait for the laser cutter to travel to 'home'Use the up-down-left-right buttons on the control panel to move the laser head out of the way so that you can position your materialThe Cutting area of the Laser is: 250mm x 500mm or 9.625 in x 19.3 inThe Engraving area of the Laser is less than 500mmWhen engraving, the laser head needs to move past the edge of the engravingHow far past the edge of the engraving is dependent upon the speed of the engrave. Faster = Farther (300 speed = approx .5" on each side)If the laser head needs to travel outside the edge of the bed and cannot, it will immediately stop the job and flag an error (See Troubleshooting)Using the 'Z/U' function, position the Z axis of the laser cutter to your desired height.There is a wooden block labeled "Laser Focus Guide" on/near the laser.Hold the wooden block vertically, such that the "notched" end is on topSet the un-notched edge on the top of your material and use the Z/U function to set the metal plate holding the nozzle onto the "notch" of the wooden blockPress the Z/U button on the laser control panelUse the down-arrow to select the Z-Axis option then wait a couple of secondsUse the up/down arrows to adjust the Z axisMost of the time you want the focal point to be at the very top of your material, so set the bottom of the nozzle plate onto the notch of the focusing blockIf the laser will not go "down" far enough, see instructions in the Troubleshooting SectionThese steps will place the laser focal point at the surface of your materialUse the up-down-left-right buttons to position the laser head at your "origin point" (the point identified by the blue dot within LaserCad)Press the "Laser" button to "test-fire" the laser to verify your origin point- WARNING!!! Do NOT leave your hands inside the frame when test-firing the laser! (Yes, you can burn yourself. Yes, it HURTS!)Once you have the laser head at your desired origin point, press the "Origin" button to set the origin positionAfter downloading your file, press the Box button. The laser head will travel the outside path of your image so that you can verify the position of your materialClose the lidPress the green Start buttonThe laser will beep when finished.- the control panel will display the elapsed time of your jobWhen the job completes, check the time (if you care), lift the lid, and use the up-down-left-right buttons to move the laser head out of the way.Operating the Big Laser CutterThe Big laser cutter has a bed size of 900mm x 1200mm (roughly 3' x 4') Please do NOT attempt to adjust the Z-Height!Do not use the control panel Z-axis buttons at all!!! Currently the z-height is limited to approximately 3-inches tall. Upgrades are planned which will hopefully, eventually allow engraving of items approximately 8-inches deep.To operate:On the right side of the laser is a large panel of switches:Laser SwitchesTurn on chiller switch first. It will make alarm-sounds at you when it first turns on. If the building is over about 85 degrees when you turn it on, wait about 5 minutes before starting your job to allow things to start cooling down. Once it "gets to temperature" you should never hear the alarm-sounds again. If you do hear alarm-sounds after the initial starting alarm, STOP THE JOB IMMEDIATELY! The tube is in danger of overheating and being ruined. Turn on the Z and the XY switches. They will re-set the laser first to the home position (Home is defined as the top right corner) and then move the laser head to the last Origin point If the laser is running and you hit "Reset" it will re-home to the last set Origin position.Turn on the LED switch to turn on the interior lightsThe Laser Power switch turns on the power to the laserOnce the laser is turned on, operation moves to the top laser control panel. This panel works much like the small laser except that you have to set the z-axis manually (with the screw, NOT the arrow keys).You will NOT raise and lower the bed with the control panel, you will raise and lower the laser nozzle with your fingers after loosening the screw. To set the z-axis, use the wooden gauge to determine the proper height. Loosen and tighten the "adjustment screw" to set the focus. Do Not Use Tools on the adjustment screw!!! See images: Use the arrow keys to move the laser-head in the x and y directions to your origin point and push the origin button. Once you've downloaded your image, use "test" to trace the "box".In January, 2019, the controller for the large laser was replaced and EVERY recommended setting changed. As of January, 2019, the settings for the large laser fairly closely approximate the settings for the smaller laser. Minimum power to cut or engrave is 8%. the laser will not fire if the percentage is lower.In Late-January of 2022 the settings for a clean-cut of .25 birch were 30 speed and 40 powerBe careful of the lid. The laser will fire with the lid open. Also make sure the lid is either fully open or fully closed as it might slam shut if only partially opened.The Vent switch is for the exhaust vent. Turn on the Vent Switch just prior to running your job. If there's going to be a reasonably long break between jobs, turn the Vent switch off between jobs.Turn on the Air Comp switch just before starting the job. The air compressor pushes air through the laser nozzle to push smoke and debris out of the way of the beam.If there's going to be a reasonably long break between jobs, turn the air compressor switch off between jobs.Troubleshooting:I tried to open my .dxf file in LaserCad and I can't find itYou have to "import" .dxf files into LaserCad, not "open" themI imported my file into LaserCad and there are all sorts of extra lines that I wasn't expectingThere are a few remedies for this, though not all of them work. You can try:In Inkscape, save the file as a .PDF. Open the PDF in Corel and then save as .dxf (a good solution if you've used Inkscape Path Effect Editor to place text on a curve)Open the file in Corel and see if Corel can "automagically" clean the fileUse Corel to "trace" the image again, sometimes this gets rid of extra or overlapping nodesI opened my .svg file in Corel and there are a ton of lines exploding out of the screenInkscape has a proprietary .svg format that can cause this. Try saving as "standard .svg" or as a pdf before sending to CorelI created an image that looks great in Inkscape but it doesn't look right in Corel or LaserCadOn the main LaserCad computer - open the file in InkscapeSave it as a Windows MetaFileImport the WMF file into CorelUse the "send to laser" button in Corel to send the image to the laser.This will Often (not always) workFor the small laser Only - I tried to adjust the z-axis but it won't go "down" far enoughSelect Menu -> Axis Control -> Reset Z. Let it run until your piece fits and then hit stop. Make sure to pay attention and not jam the Z table into the bottom of the machine.From there you can adjust the Z up as needed.There are sections of my engraving missingYou might have a shape that looks closed but is not. The "end" nodes of a non-closed shape need to be joined together (there's an Inkscape option for this)You might have duplicate shapes on top of each other. This can happen in Corel's "trace" option, especially on internal closed shapes.Try this: Click on the image that's being ignored, then "move" it out of the way. If there's an exact duplicate underneath in the old location, delete one copy of the image and try againIs there a way to try to make sure that my image to engrave is going to work?Both laser computers are set to "fill in" with color any area that will engrave. If it isn't "solid" on the computer then it won't engrave properlyOn the toolbar there is a "simulate" option. Select your image, set the Engrave parameters, then hit "simulate". It will show you what it will engrave and what it will ignore.I engraved and/or cut acrylic and when I tried to clean it it suddenly had a lot of tiny cracks all overNormally indicates your acrylic is extruded rather than cast.When I tried to download an image to the laser I got a "no data" messageThis indicates that all of the layers are deselected. In the top right of the LaserCad window ensure that at least one layer has a checkmark.When I tried to start a job I got an "out of bounds" error message.Double check that your project does not extend outside of the dimensions of the laser cutter. Most commonly this is due to a misplaced origin point. For example, you expected the origin to be bottom left but it is set for top right.I was in the middle of engraving an image when the laser suddenly stopped and displayed an "out of bounds" messageEnsure that you leave room on either side of the engraving to allow the laser to accelerate and decelerate. The faster the engrave speed and the more room you'll need to leave on either side.Unfortunately there is no way to re-start an engrave if this happensI hit origin on the keypad but the machine is not actually cutting at that point.Try moving your object around on the screen within LaserCAD and redownload your file. If the object moves in the same directions on the laser cutter, send Travis an email.Material Guidelines / Examples:Big Laser: Starting suggestions for 1/8" baltic birch = power 20% at 300% speed for a nice engraving.Big Laser: Starting suggestions for 1/4" birch plywood = power 40% at speed 30 for a clean cutSmall Laser:Starting suggestions for 1/8" colored acrylic = power 20% at speed 175, for engravingSmall Laser:Starting suggestions for 1/8" colored acrylic = power 100% at speed 12, two passes for a clean cutSmall Laser:Starting suggestions for 1/4" colored acrylic = power 100% at speed 5, three passes for a clean cutBig Laser:Starting suggestions for 1/4" colored acrylic = power 100% at speed 8, one passes for a melty cutBig Laser:Starting suggestions for 1/8" colored acrylic = power 50% at speed 15, one pass for an ok cutBig Laser:Starting suggestions for 1/8" colored acrylic = power 8% at speed 150, for a shallow engraving Posted by Aaron Ward on Tuesday, November 4th, 2014 Filed under | More Latest Project Posts Build Yourself a Pallet Pool LIQUID NITROGEN ICE CREAM RECIPE FROM FIRE AND ICE Laser Engrave a Photo Basic Cutting Board Cardweaving Agenda No upcoming events

Jump to Content Secondary menu Location Calendar Community Covid-19HomeAbout ▼About UsEquipmentOrganizationMembershipPressclose this panelSpaceProjectsPhotos You are hereHome RC Sumo Bots RC Sumo Bots My idea was to create a customizable robot that adults and kids could drive at events and demonstrations. I created a 3D printed base in which motors, batteries, motor controllers, and receivers could be inserted. Then a LEGO base plate could be glued onto the front of the base. Each part inside has a JST connector so that it can quickly be changed out for another part without soldering wires.At Arch Reactor (AR) we have recently tried to create a cardboard robot combat league. AR purchased controllers and receivers various motors, motor shields, and wheels. We were at FIre and Ice having a fighting competition and we let the kids and adults fight with the robots. They loved it.While I am sure having a combat robot with a weapon is more fun than a sumo bot the problem with active weapons is that they tend to destroy things. Which, while lots of fun, active weapons doesn’t lead to a lot of repeatable fun. I thought if we had a robot base that was rigid, a part that was customizable, and a play area to fall off of then it would be possible to create a “Combative” robot. The best part is that it could be repeated over and over again.I created using the online TinkerCad program at tinkercad.com a few designs for a robot base. By a few, I mean more than 10. I had initially decided to go with slots so that motors, batteries, and receivers could be dropped into placeI sourced motors from Adafruit but when I went to purchase them they were sold out so I purchased them from Amazon. I found out that these motors are called TT motors. Parameter Operating voltage: 3V-6V DC TT Motor. These have one axle but you can get TT motors with two axles. These motors normally come with press-on tires. The link I have provided comes with LEGO adapters to let one install the motors into a Lego machine. You don’t have to use those exact motors you can use any TT motor in this robot base. Hunter at AR soldered the JST female connectors to the motors.For the batteries, I was able with the help of Elias S. from AR I was able to get recycled laptop batteries that are essentially 2s Lithium-Ion batteries with 5000+ mAh operating at a max of 8.4V. Elias soldered the batteries together and attached male JST connectors on the batteries. I had bought a Lipo balance charger when I was going to try and compete in cardboard combat robots. The charger will charge almost any battery so I bought JST charger connectors.To control the robots you need a 2.4Ghz 2 channel remote control and receiver. If you have time to wait for an order from China then you can get controllers and receivers for as low as $25. The receivers are used to plug in motor speed controls called Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) which are simple devices that control the speed of motors. I have used 2 of these in each robot one ESC for each motor. You could instead use an Arduino (any model) and a motor shield to plug into motors but programming is required and the program cares what transmitter you are using whereas the ESC doesn’t care a lick. The thing to watch for when using an ESC is that when using brush motors like these TT motors you need a brush motor ESC. The other thing is the amp rating not much of an issue with TT motors because of the max amps at stall (which is the most amps used by motors) with 1.2 amps. Any Radio Controlled (RC) ESC for brushed motors and more than 1.2 amps will work. I like the ones with a brake and switch. Also, another thing to look for is an RC ESC with JST connectors for ease of plugin into this robot’s setup.You can use the press on tires and wheels that come with the motors. If you, however, want to change up the tires you can use this axle STL file I have created to allow you to use 12mm hex tires which are kind of the standard for RC cars and trucks.The final part of all this a LEGO base front. I bought some cheap brick base from Amazon and have cut it down to glue it to the front of the 3D printed base. I have borrowed Legos from my kids and have gotten some from a thrift store. The idea is that people can build out the front of the robot however they like.Things I have learned so far JST connectors are backward from normal connectors in that the one with the metal pins is the female connector. 3D Printing is awesome and because it is possible leads to many revisions. The robot motors are called TT.Parts List:3D Printed Bases and LidsBrick BaseTT Motors and WheelsBatteriesJST Connectors 10 pairsBrush RC ESC 10A with brake and switchJST Y Connector 1 female to 2 male connectorsJST Male Connectors X 6JST Battery balance charger connector3D Printed Axle Extenders with Hex adapter2.4Ghz RC Transmitter and receiver with 2 channels Posted by Tom Blevins on Tuesday, June 19th, 2018 Filed under #robot 3D arduino Bot Build diy | More Latest Project Posts Build Yourself a Pallet Pool LIQUID NITROGEN ICE CREAM RECIPE FROM FIRE AND ICE Laser Engrave a Photo Basic Cutting Board Cardweaving Agenda No upcoming events

An Xbox 360 was used as a scanner and attached to a tripod. A rotating scanning table was created. This table is based on a lazy susan concept with a ball bering that can handle 1000 lbs. A wooden platform was attached to the lazy susan and a repurposed motor from a powerweels toy was used to turn the person on the table. A custom wheel had to be fabricated to provide traction and a spring plate was used to hold the motor against the platform.This is the scanner at the Archon boothAn image of the scanning table.

Jump to Content Secondary menu Location Calendar Community Covid-19HomeAbout ▼About UsEquipmentOrganizationMembershipPressclose this panelSpaceProjectsPhotos You are hereHome Basic Cutting Board Basic Cutting Board Basic Project: Cutting BoardTools:Saw Stop (table saw)JointerPlanerMaterials:I picked up $15 of random wood castoffs to use. I also purchased some butcher block oil for a finish, you could probably use any finish (just check for food safety).Project Build:For this project I rummaged through the castoff wood section at Woodcraft. As you can see in the photo - my wood is in bad shape (I didn’t pick the worst I could find, but I didn’t sort for the best pieces). The first thing that I need to do is to prepare the lumber - first too square it off and then to level the wood pieces down to uniform thickness. I started by using the jointer.The manual for the jointer can be found here. As always use eye protection and make sure that the woodshop ventilation is on, the vents routed to your equipment, and actually attached to the equipment (it happens). It’s not just better for the equipment, it makes clean up go a lot smoother.Using the jointer is pretty straight forward - I started by getting one of the sides of the board squared off. This is the easiest place to start since it doesn’t have a lot of material (compared to the flat, wide face) and isn’t overly warped. Just take it slow and use shallow cuts (adjust the cut depth with the crank on the machine).With one edge squared off, I figured it would be easier to just run the other side through the table saw (manual here) to even it out.You can see in the photo where there was some burning from the saw blade. There are a couple of things that could cause this including the saw blade not being sharp enough or the fence not being aligned properly. (Link with info)Finally I could joint the top and bottom of the board. I did these last because I do need to be able to apply even pressure.One major lesson here is that as I was jointing the boards, I would get a little bit of tearing. I was keeping steady pressure on the board as rolled over the cutting head, without necessarily forcing it downward. Reviewing the manual/ light googling later, it turns out that running the board through the cutting head with the grain facing a certain way makes this process much easier. For the cherry wood, this wasn’t an issue but the walnut was much harder and had more tearing issues.With the boards squared, I then began to use the planer to get the boards to uniform thickness. Again, and this seems repetitive but needs to be said, if you have the ventilation system hooked up and running to this equipment it will save you a lot of time cleaning up wood shavings.Planer manual.Planing is straight forward, there were no major surprises using this tool.Again shallow cuts and patience.With the boards now uniformly thick I was ready to actually construct the cutting board. For the first time, I measured my boards and sized out how large I wanted my cutting board to be. Exact size obviously doesn’t really matter. I then took each board and cut them into ~1.5” strips using the table saw.The glue up was surprisingly difficult, and not something I’d done before. I knew that I needed to use vices to hold the pieces together, but I didn’t think about how to keep the surface of the cutting board even. The best way to do it is to use other pieces of square lumber as a press to keep the boards even - making sure to wrap them with tape so they don’t accidently get glued into the piece! With the glue on, hunting down the boards and then juggling vices was a pain. I’d really recommend doing a dry run before adding glue.I was pretty flippant with this step. I figured I’d make mistakes the first time and then document how to undo the issues I introduced.I did an awful job.Not to mention that I had dust on the bottom during the glue step that then was caked on after the glue dried. It was so bad I didn't even take a picture.I think the typical way to fix this problem is to use a combination of a hand planer to get the surface smooth, and then sand down any glue spots (glue interferes with the wood finish). After a few minutes with the random orbital sander, I realized that this current board was toast or at least a major time sync. Using the table saw, I cut the board in half lengthwise and ran the pieces through the planer again (it was just a little too wide). This got the piece back into a semi smooth finish look.I then did the glue up again on the cut I created. I was much more careful this time - I had everything ready to go and then used a screwdriver/ paper towel to gently remove any excess glue that was squeezed out when I applied the vice.At this stage, I just need to square off the ends with the table saw and then I should be ready to apply a finish. I used the random orbital sander to with 100 grit and 220 grit to smooth everything out and then applied the butcher block oil according to instructions.This was a super simple project to do and let me get a little bit of experience using the woodshop tools.

It has travelled to Maker Faire KC, Prom, and Abby and Nate used it to make their wedding invitations.Project Progress and Details:For those who want to use it there are a few quirks to follow. One is when letting out the pressure to not let it out all the way. That is, only let up enough so you can slip out the plate. Letting all the pressure out makes the jack leak and shortens its life. Second is to make sure you completely clean and dry the plates after use. There is an orange bucket that has extra 100% cotton paper, plates, ink and cleaning supplies. If you have any questions about operation just drop me a line and I can give a short lesson.Letterpress v.2 will be coming when the current one needs to be retired to the great garage in the sky. New version will have casters for portability, narrow drawers to store materials, and a folding table built in to allow printing without the need of any external table.Storage or Location: Currently residing on the table in the assembly area next to member storage.

Keep up the good work! We support you! Readmore... Face Shield Initiative STL Posted on Monday, Mar 23rd, 2020 In response to the quick and drastic needs of our local healthcare workers, the community of St. Louis makers and makerspaces have united to help fabricate much-needed hardware for nurses, EMTs and doctors.Led by maker David Cervantes, Face Shield Initiative STL is composed of volunteer community leaders from MADE Makerspace, Inventor Forge, and Arch Reactor. Together we are pooling the maker resources at hand to help the 1st responder teams, doctors, nurses, and medical staff by fabricating face shields. There is an overwhelming demand or face shields used to protect the facemasks in which medical/responder staff has a finite quantity.We are responding to this demand by activating local makerspaces and individual makers with access to 3D printers to print an open-source harness made by Prusa Research. Volunteer makers with access to laser cutters or Cricuts are helping by cutting out the transparent PETG face shield film. Volunteers are also aiding by shuttling the materials required to print the harness, the film, and delivery to those in need.We have now pooled over 15 printers and 6 laser cutters so we can pump out our initial goal of 300 face shields for Barnes-Jewish Hospital. We want to help as many health care workers and hospitals as we can. There has been an overwhelming request to help other medical centers and cities; we want to help as many health care workers andhospitals as we can. The St. Louis community has already donated over $800 in funds to help supplement our material and transportation costs.We are restricted by time, material resources, and budgets. This entire operation is a bootstrap effort; every volunteer has used their personal funds and resources in an uncertain economic climate to help others. We are making progress obtaining the PETG face shields, but still require a solid supply. While our maker community continues torun their 3D printers around the clock, we will quickly run out of PETG and PLA filament, and the elastic bands used to aid securing the shields will run low.We delivered the first batch of prototypes today, March 22nd, for product refinement to doctors, nurses and first responders.

Jump to Content Secondary menu Location Calendar Community Covid-19HomeAbout ▼About UsEquipmentOrganizationMembershipPressclose this panelSpaceProjectsPhotos You are hereHome 1Sheeld stuff 1Sheeld stuff I backed the 1Sheeld(yes that's spelled correctly) on kickstarter and it arrived today. Was very easy to get working, though bluetooth seemed a little unstable with my galaxy S3, but my old S1 worked great.So the first project was to strap it (haphazardly) to a magician chassis with an h-bridge IC and use the Orientation sheeld (that's their name for the virtual shields on the phone) to drive the bot. Video of 1Sheeld with a Magician Chassis Source code. This includes a robot library I've been working on, so far does motor control abstraction for h-bridge and dual-RC-servo and optional speed ramping/smoothing. Feedback and improvements welcome.

Watch the Arch Reactor calendar the month prior to Easter every year as we host annual in-house Egg-Days!SpaceEgg_2019We offer free classes/decorating-sessions every spring, often in March. Watch for announcements about AR Egg-Days every spring!AR Egg-Day(s) Info:Pysanky are decorated using whole, raw chicken eggs and hot beeswax melted over candle flames. This is not a craft for small, exciteable children, though many childrenhave successfully decorated beautiful eggs. Any child decorating will need to be closely supervised and assisted by a parent, please. Safety will be paramount as we are using live flames in this craft. There is no charge to decorate eggs and everything to decorate will be supplied. If you appreciate this class and have the means you are welcome to make a modest donation to Arch Reactor. It takes most beginners approximately 3 hours to complete one Pysanka but there is a lot of "waiting" time so it's often possible to compete two eggs in approximately 4 hours. During AR Egg-Days, people are welcome to make multiple eggs and/or may work on egg(s) over multiple sessions, but please be sure to complete your eggs by the end of the last day. The times listed are when an "instructor" will be on-site but the supplies will be available whenever Arch Reactor is open during the posted date-range.Interested in learning more about decorating Pysanky?

Jump to Content Secondary menu Location Calendar Community Covid-19HomeAbout ▼About UsEquipmentOrganizationMembershipPressclose this panelSpaceProjectsPhotos You are hereHome About ▼ About Us About Us Arch Reactor was founded in 2009 at a local pizza joint by a group of friends who liked technology, programming, making, and pizza. Our first decision was to create a donation can to save for our first space. That donation can (and the $7 that started in it) took us from the food court, to a borrowed apartment, to our first space at the Lemp Brewery (which we outgrew in 3 months!), to our second space at the Jefferson Underground, and finally to our current location in the former Dixie Cream Donut Flour factory. Now St. Louis' original and largest hackerspace, Arch Reactor's growing membership continues to bring new skills, projects, equipment, and people to one place.We fall under the umbrella of the hackerspace and maker movements. While some of our members are involved in the information security industry, you won't have any fear of getting your phone or computer hacked by visiting our space. The hacking we do is creative, not destructive. When we refer to hacking, we mean either the re-purposing or modification of a commercial product, DIY hacking together of a project, or just the act of exciting, creative work.We are a 501c3 Educational Non-Profit Organization. Our space is a communal workshop for our members to share tools and work on projects. It is also a place to learn new skills, either in one of our classes or from the many experts that make up our membership. Most importantly, we are a welcoming and creative place for all makers in the St. Louis area.Hours:Members have keys and 24/7 access to the space, but everyone is always welcome to visit the space when it's open. If you would like to check us out or have a project you would like to bring in to work on, please check the calender for scheduled events. Generally, all events are free and open to the public.* We are open nearly every Tuesday and Sunday night from approximately 7pm until the last full member leaves. Watch the website front page, our twitter feed (@archreactorSTL), our public mailing list (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/arch-reactor) or join us on our IRC channel (#archreactor on chat.freenode.net) and see Archbot's notifications on when the space is open. If it is, come on out! * Occasionally an event will request a donation to help cover costs, or a class may require material fees. Very rarely, there will be a members-only event, but these are few and far between and will be stated clearly on the calendar far in advance.

They do this by moving towards sunlight and beeping when the moisture of the plant is low. This allows the robot to warn you when the plant needs water while keeping the plant in the sunlight longer than normal potted plant can. These robots are hexapod robots. For example, hexapod robots can step over various obstacles, like a book, that a wheeled robot can not.The light sensor should be facing angled towards the front of the robot with a clear line of sight to work correctlyParts list:All printed parts3x Hitec HS-422 Servos1x Light blue Bean controller18 M3 x 11 screws1x CDS photoresistor2x 220 ohm resistors1x 1k ohm resistor1x 22 uf capacitor2x LED any color1x Octopus Soil Moisture Sensor1x misc wires1x Great Planes Threaded 2-56 Ball Link Set (Set of 6)1x small plant/soil8x 10-24 x 3/4 inch or metric equivalent3x 10-24 x 2 inch or metric equivalent1x 3.3 volt drop out regulator or DC-DC drop in replacement, part number LD1117v33c1x buzzer 3.3 volt or 5 volt1x 4 AA battery holder4x AA batteries (rechargeable if possible)1x 1/4 scrap plastic, you will need to laser cut to base panels the 133 mm wide and 230 mm long The top base plate needs a cutout for the plant pot that measures 68 mm in diameter.

The cabinet has been in our Classroom for a while with a loaner-machine, but our own machine is back from its professional cleaning and calibration.<!--break-->Opened up:Sewing Machine Cabinet - OpenSewing Supplies in the top two right-side drawers:Top Drawer - Pins, fabric (ONLY!) scissors, rulers, seam rippers, buttons, hand-sewing needlesSewing Machine - top Right drawerDrawer 2 - Right side:Thread, bobbins, sewing machine needles, other feet, THE MANUAL!!!

NOMcon Virtual Conference going on this week until Saturday! Here's what you're missing: [field_thumbnail]Wow! What an amazing NOMCON we’ve had so far. We started Day 1 off with afantastic Keynote by Dr. Leah Hanes from Two Bit Circus Foundation, celebratedthe amazing Infy Maker Award recipients, and launched into a full day of incrediblepanels, roundtables, workshops, spark sessions and fireside chats. We finished ourincredible programming for the day with a discussion of our Core Principles and howmaker organizations can begin the important work of putting them into action. And ofcourse, we still had a Happy Hour - our cocktail hour was a nice break to see eachother’s faces, enjoy some fun conversations (what are YOU binge watching thesedays?), and to experience a little of the maker love that we all feel during in-personNOMCON.But, as with any event, there were also some bumps in the road - and yesterday,that was the magical mystery of the disappearing Zoom links. In true Scooby Doofashion, we figured out the culprit, and we are making sure we don’t have a repeatof that technical glitch for the remainder of our conference. We are sorry for anyinconvenience for our attendees, speakers, exhibitors, and sponsors. We aregrateful to all of you who attended yesterday - for your patience, grace, andkindness during the technical issues, and for sticking with us in spite of them. And intrue maker fashion, many of you jumped in as last minute volunteers (with joy!),because, well, that’s what we, as a maker community do (we fix things!) - for that,we are especially grateful.Now who’s excited for Day 2?We are! Today’s Keynote comes from Dr. Paul Bunje from Conservation X Labs,who will speak to us about "Empowering Everyone to End the Sixth MassExtinction". Don’t go the way of the dinosaurs - join us! That will be followed by evenmore exciting programming including some special sessions from the Department ofEnergy about their new Geothermal Prize, including how innovative uses of additivemanufacturing in geothermal could save the day! And of course, we’ll have anothercocktail hour with breakouts and fun topics to discuss (and possibly games!).Finally, don’t forget to visit our virtual exhibit booths from XPrize, MatterHackers andShopBot as well as our Film Screening of Me and My Robot. There is a lot of greatinformation, live session info and contests, and an absolutely great movie for you toview.MatterHackers will be having a daily giveaway drawing for attendees that addthe MatterHatter booth to their schedule.

Jump to Content Secondary menu Location Calendar Community Covid-19HomeAbout ▼About UsEquipmentOrganizationMembershipPressclose this panelSpaceProjectsPhotos You are hereHome ESP8266 ESP8266 Documenting my adventures with theESP8266 wifi module. First things first, solder on the pins. I wanted to be able to use the module on a bredboard, so since the outer 2 pairs are all that is needed I soldered like so:The pins in the back are just to hold the board level while solering. Pro Tip there. I also found that one pin in particular has to be pulled to VCC in order for the module to "come alive", so I added a little jumper wire:Next, I connected it to a Leonardo clone. I decided to use the Leonardo since it's 0,1 serial are seperate from the usb-serial, makes debugging easier.The wiring is basically from Seeed's guide athttp://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/WiFi_Serial_Transceiver_Module. I was not able to get Seeed's code to work though. I would get the "Can not connect to the WiFi" message 5 times and that's it. imjosh's code athttps://github.com/imjosh/espBasicExample/blob/master/espBasicExample.inoalso failed, but copying the "serial loop mode for diag" section up to the connection fail section I was able to make ti connect by manually issuing AT commands. In both cases I modified the programs to use the Leonardo's Serial and Serial1.Since I had success with a manual config, I think the issue may lay in the brute force methods and lack of validation that this code uses. When I get some time soon I'm going to start over from scratch and try to duplicate my manual config method and add in that validation. UPDATES:I was able to have some better success by removing the delays in the serial loops. It seems it was filling the buffer faster than the code was reading it and timing out. I also now have some better documentation and example sessions:Command Doc Socket Client Socket Server (incomplete example) AP and Socket Client Posted by Chris Weiss on Tuesday, September 23rd, 2014 Filed under arduino | More Latest Project Posts Build Yourself a Pallet Pool LIQUID NITROGEN ICE CREAM RECIPE FROM FIRE AND ICE Laser Engrave a Photo Basic Cutting Board Cardweaving Agenda No upcoming events
