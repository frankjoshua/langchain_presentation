LlamaIndex is a data framework designed to connect custom data sources to large language models (LLMs). It offers the following features:

Data Ingestion: It allows you to connect your existing data sources and formats (such as APIs, PDFs, documents, SQL, etc.) to use with a large language model application.

Data Indexing: LlamaIndex can store and index your data for different use cases. It can integrate with downstream vector store and database providers.

Query Interface: LlamaIndex provides a query interface that accepts any input prompt over your data and returns a knowledge-augmented response.

This makes LlamaIndex a simple and flexible tool for enhancing the capabilities of LLM applications by integrating them with custom data sources.
